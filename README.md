# Simple Message Queue (SMQ / vSMQ)

Simple Message Queue (SMQ / VSMQ) provides a simple set of routines 
(written in C) which provide a thread-safe mechanism for sending 
messages between threads. Only 6 public (non-static) functions are
exposed and required to send the messages. Locking is performed
by the codebase itself. Threads waiting on messages have timeout
values (in milliseconds) and condition variables are used to limit
CPU usage.

## SMQ vs vSMQ

SMQ is provides for a fixed size of data to be written as a message,
where-as vSMQ provides an optional extension, allowing memory 
pointers to be used and passed around more easily from the message 
queue. Essentially, SMQ is the base code and vSMQ is a wrapper
providing more flexible access. 

## Examples

Examples to both SMQ and vSMQ usage is available in the examples/
directory. Please read the comments at the top of each file for
information on how to compile the example.

### examples/smq_example1.c

Creates different objects containing a value between 0 and 100 and
writes those into the queue. Threads then read and simply output
the value. 

### examples/smq_example2.c

Uses a pointer and stores it and shows how to use ``onfree'' callback
to free memory. Has no threading as part of the example; provides
some additional insight into how the information is moved/stored.

### examples/vsmq_example1.c

Pushes words from /usr/share/dict/words into a queue and is read
by thread processes. Uses the vSMQ wrappers to simply write a string
into the queue. Additional comments are in the file.ÃŸ

### Public Functions (SMQ)

`SMQ smq_create(int data_size, int max_queue_size, void (*onfree_callback)(void *))`

Creates an SMQ create object. 

* The ``data_size`` is the size of each element written and read from the queue. A
data_size of less than or equal to 0 will result in NULL being returned.
* The ``max_queue_size'' is the maximum number of items which can exist in the queue.
Once this value is reached, then smq_send will block (wait state) for the queue's
readers to remove items, until the queue size is below ``max_queue_size''. 
If ``max_queue_size'' is <= 0, then the queue will be virtually unlimited (except
by memory).
* The ``onfree_callback'' is a function which is called on destroy or wipe for any 
item should additional memory need to be freed or addressed in some way. If NULL
is specified, no callback is performed.

Returns the SMQ object if successful, otherwise NULL is returned.

<br><br>
`int smq_send(SMQ smq, void *data, int timeout_ms)`

Sends a message to the queue. 
* smq is the object previously created with smq_create and is the queue. 
* Data is the data to copy into the queue and must be the size
specified by the ``data_size'' argument to smq_create. If data is NULL, nothing will
be written and error will be returned.
* Timeout_ms is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for a write. If
timeout_ms is < 0, then wait will be unspecified (indefinite); if 
timeout_ms is 0, then we will not wait for a write-ready state, we attempt
a write only once cycle before failure. If timeout_ms is greater than 0, then
we wait that specified amount of time in milliseconds for data to write-ready.

Returns 0 on success and < 0 on failure (unable to write).

<br><br>
`int smq_recv(SMQ smq, void *data, struct timeval *tv, int timeout_ms)`

Receives a message from the queue (consumer).
* smq is the object previously created with smq_create.
* data is the data to copy from the queue into the address pointed to by data, whose
size will be that defined from smq_create.
* tv will be copied and is the time the message was received (timestamp). If
tv is NULL, this will not result in error, but the timestamp will not be copied.
* timeout_ms is the number of milliseconds to wait for data to become available. 
If timeout_ms is < 0, then we will wait an indefinite amount of time. If timeout_ms
is 0, then we will attempt to read the data, but only once; we will not wait for
new data to become available. If timeout_ms is greater than 0, then we wait that
period of time (in milliseconds) for new data to become available.

Returns non-zero on receipt of data or 0 if no data is available.

<br><br>
`int smq_get_count(SMQ smq)`

Get the count of the number of items in the queue.
* smq is the object created earlier by smq_create.

Returns the number of items currently in the queue.

<br><br>
`int smq_destroy(SMQ smq)`

Destroy and free all items in the queue. The object is freed along with every item
being removed. Mutexes and Condition variables are also destroyed.
* smq is the object created earlier by smq_create

Returns 0 at the moment.

<br><br>
`void smq_wipe(SMQ smq)`

Removes all items currently in the queue, but the queue itself remains available.
* smq is the object created by smq_create

Returns nothing as-is void. All items are dropped/purged.
